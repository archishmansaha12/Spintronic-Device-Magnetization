# Spintronic-Device-Magnetization

In order to estimate the Write Error Rate (WER) during switching dynamics of a spintronics, we model it as a probability density function. The time evolution of this probaility density is captured using the Fokker-Planck Equation.

This repository aims at solving the Fokker-Planck Equation in a simple spintronic device incorporating thermal fluctuations. The Fokker-Planck equation involves a velocity term which is calculated using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation.
