# Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equation

The code uses the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equation to calculate the velocity term in the Fokker-Planck Equation for establishing the relationship between magnetization probability density function and time. We, thus neglect the effect due to current-induced torque (Spin Transfer Torque and Spin Orbit Torque).

The effect of STT and SOT can be added on later to modify the existing code, which also considers only anistropic, VCMA induced and external magnetic field effects. The demagnetization term needs to be added too in order to obtain the complete code for LLG equation.
